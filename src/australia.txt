Hi Isaac!

I'm Daniel, I'm from Mexico.
I'm learning English and I'm trying to write this letter.

I'm 28 years old, I work in Mexico City as Web Developer 
in a tech company named TiLatina.
I like to make web pages and web applications too and 
everything that the end-user can watch and manipulate with his phone or computer.

Now I'm working in a project for cars where you can verify if your doors are closed and 
if the system detects that a door is opene the car emits an alarm also turns on a siren.

Maybe in future you will hear more about this project.

Also, I like movies, especially comedy movies and action movies. 
My favorite movie in the world is Back to the future (the trilogy).
This is my favorite movies list:
  1 Back to the future
  2 Die Hard
  3 Forrest Gump
  4 It (90's)
  5 El padrecito 

But now, tell me about you. 
How long have you lived in Australia?
How old are you? 
Have you seen a kangoroo? 
What do you thing about spiders? do you like them? 

I would like to know more about you.

Greetings from Mexico.

PD. Where we go we don't need roads
